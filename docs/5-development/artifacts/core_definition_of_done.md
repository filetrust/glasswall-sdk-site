title: Core Definition of Done
---

### Overview

A Product Backlog Item (PBI) is 'Done' when it meets an agreed level of quality and therefore could be delivered to the customer immediately, should a business decision be made to do so. This page forms a list of criteria which must be met before a product backlog item is considered "done".

### Check-list

- The Acceptance Criteria of a User Story must be met. There must be no scope creep or gold plating.

### All contributions must:

- Be checked in to the Source Control repository.
- Comply with our coding standards.
- Covered by new unit tests, or where required existing ones should be modified to reflect the new functionality.
- Be code reviewed by at least 1 reviewer.

### Make sure:

- Main builds complete successfully upon check-in on all supported platforms.
- Unit test pass rate is 100%.

### In test:

- Test cases should be automated within the same sprint.
- Test cases in a PBI should be manually tested at least once.
- All manual & automated tests must pass.
- Bug fixes must be added to the past bug regression and the configuration must be reviewed.

### Other	

- For applications and tools, basic documentation should be created containing prerequisites and basic usage guidelines.

- The PBI is complete when all associated tasks are complete or the team agrees the Backlog Item is done.

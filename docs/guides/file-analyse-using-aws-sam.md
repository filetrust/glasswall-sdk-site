title: File Analyse using AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)
---

## Background

The File Analyse Product leverages azure serverless functions, with an AWS gateway api
redirecting requests and limiting usage. The purpose of this exercise was to convert the
azure components to AWS counterpart Lambda’s.

## Solution Overview

The Azure Function relies on a multipart binary file being in the body of the request, however
this does not work as expected on a deployed Lambda, since decoding of the incoming
lambda request seems to lose the content when received by the code. Two endpoints have
been produced to allow for alternative mechanisms for file analyse :

The following endpoints can be reused by other products, provided they have a way of
converting a file to base64 or providing a URL to a file. A good way of using the API would
be by leveraging the s3 file upload product. Refer to the S3 File Upload Product
documentation to find out how to generate read SAS tokens that can be used on this API

## Endpoints

### /api/Analyse/base64

**Example Workflow Diagram:![Figure6](/img/docs/guides/Figure6.png)**

  This endpoint allows a client service to send a base64 encoding of a file in the body. A
  limitation of this however, is that you cannot send a file larger than lambda’s maximum
  request size of 6MB.

  **Example Request Generated by Postman:**

 ```
 curl --location --request POST '[API GATEWAY URL]/api/Analyse/base64' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
  "Base64": “[YOUR BASE64 GOES HERE]”
  }’
  ```

  This endpoint does the following:
- Decodes the base64 file
  - If it is unsuccessful it returns BAD REQUEST
  - If it is successful then it will send the file to the core engine.
- Default content management rules are applied.
- The core engine will then analyse
  - If successful the XML analysis report will be returned in an OK response.
  - Otherwise an internal server error will occur
  
### /api/Analyse/sas

  This endpoint allows a client to send a SAS url to a file to be downloaded and have its
  contents analysed. An added benefit of this is the benefit of being able to upload files over
  the 6MB size threshold.

  **Example Request Generated by Postman:**
```
  curl --location --request POST '[API GATEWAY URL]/api/Analyse/sas' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         --data-raw '{
  "SasUrl": "[YUR SAS URL GOES HERE]"
  }'
  ```
  Example:

  ![Figure8](/img/docs/guides/Figure8.png)

  This endpoint does the following:
- Downloads the file found at SasUrl using a GET request.
  - If it is unsuccessful it returns BAD REQUEST
  - If it is successful then it will send the file to the core engine.

- Default content management rules are applied
  - The core engine will then analyse
    - If successful the XML analysis report will be returned in an OK response.
    - Otherwise an internal server error will occur
 

  ## Deployment Option 1 - Visual studio

  ### Pre-requisites
1. Visual Studio 2017 or 2019 installed.
1. AWS Toolkit extension for Visual Studio
1. AWS SAM CLI
1. Credentials configured for AWS

### Steps:

1. Clone repo https://github.com/filetrust/cloud-serverless-sdk
1. Open .sln file Glasswall.CloudSdk.AWS
1. Right click on project Glasswall.Cloudsdk.AWS.Analyse
1. Click publish to AWS lambda
1. For options:
   1. Account profile: Choose one that has permissions to create a cloud formation.
   1. Region: Where the lambda will run
   1. Stack name: This will be what the name of the stack the cloud formation will
   use, resources will use this in their name.
   1. S3 bucket: The bucket where the source code will be zipped and uploaded
   too


## Deployment Option - 2: Manually create cloud formation

### Pre-requisites

1. An aws account
1. Permissions to create cloud formations

### Steps:

1. Create a bucket for the deployed code.
1. Upload Deployment zip into bucket, take note of the name
1. Edit serverless.template file, update the codeuri field to reflect the location of the
   deployment.
   - Format example: s3://nameofbucket/nameoffolder/nameof.zip
1. Log on to aws
1. Navigate to AWS CloudFormation
1. Create a stack
   ![Figure9](/img/docs/guides/Figure9.png)

1. Select serverless.template from disk
   ![Figure10](/img/docs/guides/Figure10.png)

1. Enter a name for the stack
1. Click next until end and finish

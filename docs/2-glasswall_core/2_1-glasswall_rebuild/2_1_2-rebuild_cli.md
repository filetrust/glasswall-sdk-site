The Glasswall Rebuild CLI is a CLI wrapper around the Rebuild engine. The CLI tool can be used to verify the output of 
API functions in the Glasswall Rebuild library. The Glasswall CLI tool is typically used as a test or evaluation tool. 
The results can be examined and compared to give you a clear understanding of any issues or unwanted content within 
files and any action carried out by the Glasswall Rebuild engine.

A guide to using Glasswall Rebuild CLI in windows or Linux can be found at 
[here](/docs/7-tools/7_9-testing/7_9_2-GlasswallCommandLineTestTool).

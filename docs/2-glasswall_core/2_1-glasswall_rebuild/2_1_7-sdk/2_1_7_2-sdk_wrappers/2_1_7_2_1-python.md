# 1. Introduction

This is an introductory guide on how to use the language wrappers for the Glasswall API.

For each language we have provided the following:

- The required dependencies and the target platform or framework required for the language. The mentioned platforms and frameworks are the ones that were used during testing, but other versions may or may not work.
- A general overview on integrating Glasswall into a project.
- A code example demonstrating how the Glasswall library can be used to process a directory of files. Each example shows the file being processed in Manage and Protect mode as well as being analysed in Analysis mode.

## 1.1 Issues to consider during implementation

- The Glasswall library is not thread safe, which means that the language wrappers are not thread safe. This can be overcome by running the Glasswall library in a separate process.
- We recommend that the Glasswall library is run in separate process in case unforeseen issues arise.

# 2 Python

## 2.1 Files provided

The Python wrapper is provided as a single Python file that you reference in your application.

_Glasswall.py_ â€“ The Python file containing the Glasswall module that is responsible for interacting with the Glasswall library.

## 2.2 Framework dependencies

The Python wrapper requires either Python 2.7 or Python 3 to be installed.

## 2.3 Wrapper integration

The Python wrapper can be integrated by importing the Glasswall module.

## 2.4 Code example

```python

import os
import argparse

from Glasswall import *

def getCmdArgs():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Glasswall Python Wrapper Example')

    parser.add_argument('-i', action="store", dest="i", help="Input Directory",         type=str)
    parser.add_argument('-o', action="store", dest="o", help="Output Directory",        type=str)
    parser.add_argument('-c', action="store", dest="c", help="Path to CM config file",  type=str)
    parser.add_argument('-p', action="store", dest="p", help="Path to .DLL or .SO",     type=str)

    args = parser.parse_args()

    return args.i, args.o, args.c, args.p

def writeFile(fileName, outputDir, content):
    fileHandler = open(os.path.join(outputDir, fileName), "wb")
    fileHandler.write(content)
    fileHandler.close()

def main():
    inputDirectory, outputDirectory, pathToConfig, pathToLib = getCmdArgs()

    print("Loading Library...")
    #  Load Glasswall Lib
    gw = Glasswall(pathToLib)
    print("Done!")

    os.makedirs(outputDirectory)

    #  GWFileConfigXML Test
    configFile = open(pathToConfig, "r")
    xmlContent = configFile.read()
    configFile.close()

    # Apply the content management configuration
    configXMLResult = gw.GWFileConfigXML(xmlContent)

    if configXMLResult.returnStatus != 1:
        print("Failed to apply the content management configuration for the following reason: " + gw.GWFileErrorMsg())
        return

    for root, folders, files in os.walk(unicode(inputDirectory, 'utf-8')):
        for eachFile in files:
            filepath = os.path.join(root, eachFile)

            print("Processing file: " + filepath)

            # We use the extension as the file type of the file to be processed
            filename, fileExtension = os.path.splitext(eachFile)

            # Process the file in File to Memory Protect mode
            manageAndProtectResult = gw.GWFileProtect(filepath, fileExtension[1:])

            if manageAndProtectResult.returnStatus == 1:
                writeFile(eachFile, outputDirectory, manageAndProtectResult.fileBuffer)

            # Analyse the file in File to Memory Analysis mode
            analysisResult = gw.GWFileAnalysisAudit(filepath, fileExtension[1:])
            writeFile(eachFile + ".xml", outputDirectory, analysisResult.fileBuffer)

    gw.GWFileDone()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```
## 2.5 Issues to consider

- File paths with Unicode characters need to be correctly encoded otherwise unexpected behaviour may occur.

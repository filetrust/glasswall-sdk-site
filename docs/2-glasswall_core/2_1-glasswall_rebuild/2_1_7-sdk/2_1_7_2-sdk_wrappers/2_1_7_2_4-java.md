# 1 Introduction

This is an introductory guide on how to use the language wrappers for the Glasswall API.

For each language we have provided the following:

- The required dependencies and the target platform or framework required for the language. The mentioned platforms and frameworks are the ones that were used during testing, but other versions may or may not work.
- A general overview on integrating Glasswall into a project.
- A code example demonstrating how the Glasswall library can be used to process a directory of files. Each example shows the file being processed in Manage and Protect mode as well as being analysed in Analysis mode.


## 1.1 Issues to consider during implementation

- The Glasswall library is not thread safe, which means that the language wrappers are not thread safe. This can be overcome by running the Glasswall library in a separate process.
- We recommend that the Glasswall library is run in separate process in case unforeseen issues arise.


# 2 Java


## 2.1 Files provided

The Java wrapper is supplied in two parts: A C++ library that interacts with the Glasswall library and a JAR file that allows Java to interact with the C++ library.

_libglasswall.classic.java.so.1.1.0_ – The C++ library for the Linux OS.

_glasswall.classic.java.dll_ – The C++ library for the Windows OS.

_glasswall.classic.java.jar_ – The JAR file that enables interop between Java and the C++ library. It contains two classes: Glasswall which is used for executing the Glasswall APIs and GlasswallResult which contains the results from most calls to Glasswall.


## 2.2 Framework dependencies

The Java wrapper requires a JVM installed that supports Java 8.


## 2.3 Wrapper integration

The JAR file will need to be added to your project, which will allow you to call the Glasswall library from Java. You will also need to add the path of the _glasswall.classic.java_ library to the **java.library.path** property. The Glasswall library will also need to be stored in the library search path otherwise you will get an UnsatisfiedLinkError. The Glasswall library uses signal handling in order to prevent crashes from occurring, but this can interfere with the JVM. Signal chaining will also need to be setup in order to prevent errors in Glasswall from propagating into the JVM. Information on how to set this up can be found at [https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/signals-139944.html](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/signals-139944.html)

For example, on our Linux machines we may use something like this when running the Java wrapper:

**export LD\_PRELOAD=/lib/jvm/jre-1.8.0/lib/amd64/libjsig.so**

**export LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH=.**

**java –cp glasswall.classic.java.jar:. –Djava.library.path=. …**

In the example above, the Glasswall library, the _glasswall.classic.java_ library, the _glasswall.classic.java.jar_ and the Java executable are all in the current directory.

## 2.5 Issues to consider

- Very large files can potentially cause OutOfMemoryError to occur when running in File to Memory mode. This is due to certain results being returned as byte arrays. Potential remedy is to process files in File to File mode.
- In very exceptional circumstances certain PDF documents may cause a crash to occur. Increasing the stack size of the Java application fixes this issue.

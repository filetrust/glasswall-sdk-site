# Glasswall API Language Wrapper Documentation
# C#
</div>

# 1 Introduction

This is an introductory guide on how to use the C# language wrapper for the Glasswall API.

For each language we have provided the following:

- The required dependencies and the target platform or framework required for the language. The mentioned platforms and frameworks are the ones that were used during testing, but other versions may or may not work.
- A general overview on integrating Glasswall into a project.
- A code example demonstrating how the Glasswall library can be used to process a directory of files. Each example shows the file being processed in Manage and Protect mode as well as being analysed in Analysis mode.

## 1.1 Issues to consider during implementation

- The Glasswall library is not thread safe, which means that the language wrappers are not thread safe. This can be overcome by running the Glasswall library in a separate process.
- We recommend that the Glasswall library is run in a separate process in case unforeseen issues arise.

# 2 C#


## 2.1 Files provided

_glasswall.classic.csharp.dll_ â€“ The C# wrapper is provided as a .Net Framework Class Library that can be integrated into a project and used to interact with the Glasswall library. There are two OS specific versions of the library: one for the Windows OS and one for the Linux OS. Please ensure that you reference the correct version depending on your target platform otherwise you will get a DllNotFoundException when trying to interact with Glasswall.


## 2.2 Framework dependencies

The C# wrapper requires the .Net Framework 4.5 to be installed or a Mono equivalent.

## 2.3 Wrapper integration

The wrapper can be integrated into a project by simply adding a reference to the wrapper Library. The wrapper library uses the DllImport attribute to load the Glasswall library, which means that the Glasswall library needs to be in the search path in order to be executed. More information can be found at [https://www.mono-project.com/docs/advanced/pinvoke/](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/advanced/pinvoke/)

## 2.4 Code example

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

using GlasswallSolutions;

namespace glasswall.classic.csharp.testing
{
    class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string xmlConfigPath = args[0];    // The path to the XML content management configuration
            string inputDirectory = args[1];   // The input directory
            string outputDirectory = args[2];  // The output directory

            // Print the Glasswall library version
            Console.WriteLine("Library version: {0}", Glasswall.GWFileVersion());

            Directory.CreateDirectory(outputDirectory);
            string xmlConfig = File.ReadAllText(xmlConfigPath);

            // Apply Content Management Configuration
            if (Glasswall.GWFileConfigXML(xmlConfig) != 1)
            {
                // Print the failure reason
                Console.WriteLine("Failed to load the XML config file: {0}", Glasswall.GWFileErrorMsg());
                return;
            }

            foreach (string path in Directory.EnumerateFiles(inputDirectory, "*", SearchOption.AllDirectories))
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Processing file: {0}", path);
                string outputPath = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(path));

                string extension = Path.GetExtension(path).Trim('.'); // We use the file extension as the file type
                int status = 0; // The file process status
                byte[] fileProtect; // The buffer for the protected file

                status = Glasswall.GWFileProtect(path, extension, out fileProtect); // Run the file through File to Memory Protect
                PrintProcessInfo(status); // Print out the status
                WriteAllBytes(outputPath + "." + extension, fileProtect); // Write the protected file

                string analysisFile; // The analysis report
                status = Glasswall.GWFileAnalysisAudit(path, extension, out analysisFile); // Analyse the file with File to Memory Analysis
                PrintProcessInfo(status); // Print out the status
                WriteAllText(outputPath + ".xml", analysisFile); // Write the analysis report
            }

            // Clean up any resources allocated by Glasswall
            Glasswall.GWFileDone();
        }

        static void WriteAllBytes(string path, byte[] data)
        {
            if (data == null)   File.Create(path);
            else                File.WriteAllBytes(path, data);
        }

        static void WriteAllText(string path, string data)
        {
            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(data)) File.Create(path);
            else                            File.WriteAllText(path, data);
        }

        static void PrintProcessInfo(int fileProcessStatus)
        {
            uint processStatus = 0;
            
            Glasswall.GWFileProcessStatus(ref processStatus); // Get the process status
            Console.WriteLine("Process status: {0}", processStatus);
            Console.WriteLine("Process message: {0}", Glasswall.GWFileProcessMsg()); // Print the file process message

            if (fileProcessStatus != 1) Console.WriteLine("Glasswall error: {0}", Glasswall.GWFileErrorMsg()); // Print non-conformance reason
        }
    }
}


```


## 2.5 Issues to consider

- Very large files can potentially cause Out of Memory Exceptions to occur when running in File to Memory mode. This is due to certain results being returned as byte arrays. Potential remedy is to process files in File to File mode.
- In very exceptional circumstances certain PDF documents may cause a StackOverflowException to occur. This can be mitigated by increasing the stack size of the application.

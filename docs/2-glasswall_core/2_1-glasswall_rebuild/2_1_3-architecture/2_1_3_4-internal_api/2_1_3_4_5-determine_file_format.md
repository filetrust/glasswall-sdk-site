Glasswall Rebuild has the ability to determine the file type for a given file provided that the file format is supported by the Glasswall Rebuild engine. This enables the user to determine and supply the Glasswall processing API functions with the correct file type for the file that is to be processed, regardless of the presence of a file extension or an incorrect extension. The API that determines the file format will specify how the file format was deduced.

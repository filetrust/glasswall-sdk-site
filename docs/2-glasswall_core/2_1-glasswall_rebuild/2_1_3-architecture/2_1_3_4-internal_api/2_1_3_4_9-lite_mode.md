### Overview
Glasswall has an additional processing mode known as Lite. This allows Glasswall Rebuild to be more lenient in the interrogation of the input file manufacturer specification, whilst still providing the same high standard protection of sanitising content items regular protect mode processing provides.

You can find out more about the standard modes Glasswall Rebuild uses by following the links below.

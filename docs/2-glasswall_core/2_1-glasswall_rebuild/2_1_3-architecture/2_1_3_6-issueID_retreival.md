There are two API functions responsible for retrieving information related to issue IDâ€™s. Issue IDs are generated when files processed in analysis mode and can be found in the output analysis report. Descriptions of the API functions are as follows:-

 - The first of the two API functions is responsible for retrieving an issue description for a provided issue ID.
 - The second API function is responsible for retrieving issue descriptions for all issue ID ranges. The output XML file lists the ranges and the descriptions for each range.

## Environment
 - Ensure that the DLL (“glasswall.core2.csharp.wrapper”) is added as a reference to your environment to be able to use it.
 - Ensure that the Core2 Libraries and all required folders are accessible to the wrapper.
## Example Code
The following code uses the C# wrapper to process a file and place the tagged file in the specified directory. The tagged file is then inspected, and the tags contained within the file are extracted. This data is then saved in the specified directory.
```
using glasswall.core2.wrapper; 
using system; 
 
class Program 
    { 
        static void Main(string[] args) 
        {               
            // create Glasswall object.  
            var gw = new Glasswall("e:\\Core2_dlls"); 
  
            // Tag file
           glasswall.Tag(”e:\file_path”, “e:\data_to_tag_path”, “e:\tagged_file_path”);
           
           // retrieve tag from file
           glasswall.RetrieveTag(”e:\ tagged_file_path”, “e:\retrived_tagged_path”);
        }
    }
 ```

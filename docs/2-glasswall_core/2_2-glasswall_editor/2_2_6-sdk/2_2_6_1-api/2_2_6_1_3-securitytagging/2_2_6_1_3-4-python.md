title: 2.2.6.1.3.4 Python Wrapper
sidebar_label: 2.2.6.1.4 Python Wrapper
---

The wrapper has been tested on versions 3.6 and 2.7 of Python.

## Environment
 - You need to ensure that you have the Glasswall.py wrapper file accessible.
 - Ensure that the Core 2 libraries and all required folders are accessible to the wrapper.
 - 
## Example Code
The following code uses the Python wrapper to process a file and place the tagged file in the specified directory. The tagged file is then inspected, and the tags contained within the file are extracted. This data is then saved in the specified directory.
```
from Glasswall import Glasswall 
import ctypes as ct 
  
 class PythonWrapper:  
     # create Glasswall object. 
     gw = Glasswall(r'e:\Core2_dlls') 
 
    # Tag file
    gw.tag_file(r'e:\file_path', r'e:\data_to_tag_path', r'e:\tagged_file_path')
    
    # retrieve tag from file
    gw.retrieve_tag(r'e:\tagged_file_path', r'e:\retrived_tagged_path')
 ```

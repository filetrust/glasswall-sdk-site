## Glasswall launches it's Cloud SDK

**London, May 2020** Glasswall is proud to announce the launch of it's Cloud SDK Products, making it's award winning technology easily available to developers.

**Products**

The Cloud SDK consists of three individual products that form the building blocks on which a wide variety of use cases can be developed. Each product is serverless and can be run either on Azure or AWS, with its code being available as Open-source.

***File Type Detection*** No need to rely on file suffix of mime-type, this product looks into the file structure to establish it's type.

***Analysis*** The Glasswall technology goes through each byte of the file and produces a report describing all the elements that make up the document, along with the points of discrepency where the document format doesn't match the specification.

***Rebuild*** Remove the active content and tidy up the structure. The output of the product has been processed by the Glasswall technology and active content (a common source of malicious content) has been removed enabling the document to be distributed in the knowledge that it looks the same, but without the risks.

Each of the products is available from the Glasswall Store (https://glasswall-store.com/) with billing based on usage. To enable interested developers to try the technology for free Glasswall offers the https://file-drop.co.uk/ website where files can be uploaded and the Rebuild file with its Analysis report is available for download.

**Support**

To support developers to get the most out of their products the Glasswall Development team have also launched the Glasswall Engineering website http://engineering.glasswallsolutions.com/. Available here are:
* Descriptions of the Product APIs
* Example code of how to use the APIs, in C# and Python
* Example use cases on how the APIs can be used
* Access direct to the developers through Slack channels


*Dinis Cruz, Glasswall CISO and SVP, Engineering said* "It's awesome to be making the Glasswall technology available to other developers and having the opportunity to collaborating with them to make their great products even better, and secure!".

*Danny Lopez, Glasswall CEO also added* "Our company values include Simplicity and Collaboration. The delivery of these products and the support that the development team offers customers for them is a clear demonstration to me that those values are being upheld."

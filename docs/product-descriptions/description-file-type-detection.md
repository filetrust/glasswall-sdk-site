No need to rely on file suffix of mime-type, this product looks into the file structure to establish it's type.

---

Using the file suffix to identify a file type is a mechanism that is easily abused. Suffixes are often changed in order to circumvent policies put in place by administrators to protect their users from malicious content. The Glasswall File Type Detection product enables the file type to be accurately identified from it's structure, giving reliable and accurate assessment on which to base policy decisions.

A quick and effective way to detect file types on demand. Glasswall File Type Detection will find out if your files are what they say they are. It's easy for file extensions to be changed, either deliberately or inadvertently. Misnamed file types are risky as they can avoid security measures, allowing malware into your organisation. Masquerading files make use of this vulnerability, providing an effective way of evading detection. Glasswall's File Type Detection makes it quick and easy to avoid the risk of masquerading files. It gives peace of mind that a file really is what is says it is.

Using Glasswall technology the File Type Detection product probes into the file being assessed and examines the structure to the document. This gives a much more accurate and reliable assessment of what file type the document is. Whilst it is easy to change the file suffix and give the indication of a benign file type, the structure of the document is the true definition of its type. 

File Type Detection Product provides the benefit of this reliabiliy without the need to open the document on your own system. Using Serverless cloud-based technology the assessment is carried out in a secure environment through a simpe Web API allowing a rapid secure assessment to be made of the document.

## Tools List

### WordDissection

WordDissection.exe – how it’s used – refereneces to UCP3.1

### BinDirectoryReader

### DVL_Checker [may be renamed]

#### Purpose of tool

Give the initial parse of DVL to confirm the raw parser syntax is correct

Able to understand the meaning and check the logic of rules against the
capabilities of the language

Generate a csv list of node names verses bddl validation expressions

Generate a file of validation functions

#### Usage of tool

##### Commandline

###### -d, --dvl *filename*|*filepath*

*filename* is the name of a DVL file to be parsed. If this is the only
parameter, then this does a syntax check and reports to the commandline the
result of the parse.

if recurse option used, then \<filepath\> is used to be the start of a search
down through directories from that point, processing every \*.dvl file found.

###### \-o, --output \<output path\>

output reports and generated code are sent here.

###### \-s, --schema \<schema file \>

\<schema file\> is the full path to the root \*.BDD file that is being used to
build a camera from.

This will be parsed to find all the structures that require a validation
function generated

###### \-c, - compile

cause the validation functions to be generated and sent to the \<output path\>

###### \-r, --recurse

if recurse option used, then *filepath* is used to be the start of a search
down through directories from that point, processing every \*.dvl file found.

#### Installing and Using ANTLR

[ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/) (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser generator for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files.

Installing the Support – Using NuGet

-   Start a C\# Project

-   Tools/Extensions and Updates – Search for and install NuGet Package Manager

-   Tool/Library Package Manager/Manage NuGet Packages for Solution – Include
    Pre-releases – Install ANTLR 4 (C\# Target of Antlr parser) and Antlr 4
    Runtime (library for parsers generated by Antlr parser)

Installing the Support – without NuGet

Install the [ANTLR Language Support](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/25b991db-befd-441b-b23b-bb5f8d07ee9f)  Visual Studio Extension.

See Example steps for a new ANTLR Project in the documents:

“Setting Up ANTLR4 C\# Target in Visual Studio 2012” in

“\\\\Universal Camera Platform UCP\\Architecture\\Supporting Third Party
Documents\\Antlr”

STEP 2 does not work on Visuail Stuido express.

Simply change the build action of the g4 file to ANTLR
